### Reflection 
This was a 1 week long project built during my Third module at Moringa School of Software Development. Project goals included using technologies learned up until this point and familiarizing myself with documentation for new features.

 I started this process by using the `create-react-app` boilerplate, then adding `Materialui` and `bootstrap`.
